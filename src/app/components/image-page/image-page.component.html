<!-- TODO: add alt text for these images. There is not alt text included
so I would need to figure out a way to add text programatically
that makes sense for each photo -->

<div class="image-container" *ngIf="images$ | async as images">
    <div *ngFor="let image of objectValues(images)">
      <img class="image" [src]="image" />
    </div>
</div>
